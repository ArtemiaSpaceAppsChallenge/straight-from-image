# Drag and Drop Room System Documentation

## Overview
The game now features an intuitive drag-and-drop system that allows users to directly manipulate rooms inside the 3D isometric grid by clicking and dragging them to new positions.

## How It Works

### **Direct Room Dragging** üéØ
Simply click on any room and drag it to a new position - no special keys required!

### **Visual Feedback During Drag**
- **Gold dashed border**: Active room being dragged
- **Semi-transparent**: Room becomes 50% transparent while dragging  
- **Gold text**: Room name highlighted in gold
- **Smooth preview**: Real-time position preview as you drag
- **Cursor changes**: Grab ‚Üí Grabbing during drag operation

## User Experience

### **Step-by-Step Drag Operation**

1. **Hover Over Room**
   - Cursor changes to "grab" hand
   - Room outline becomes brighter
   - Indicates room is draggable

2. **Click and Hold**
   - Click on any room to start dragging
   - Room border becomes gold dashed line
   - Room becomes semi-transparent
   - Status overlay shows "Dragging: [Room Name]"

3. **Drag to New Position**
   - Move mouse to desired location
   - Room follows cursor in real-time
   - Position snaps to grid coordinates
   - Preview shows exactly where room will be placed

4. **Release to Place**
   - Release mouse button to finalize position
   - Collision detection validates placement
   - Toast notification confirms new position
   - If invalid (overlap), room returns to original position

### **Controls Summary**

| Action | Input | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Move Room** | Click + Drag on room | Drag room to new grid position |
| **Pan Camera** | Click + Drag on empty space | Move camera view around |
| **Rotate View** | Shift + Drag | Rotate camera angle |
| **Zoom** | Mouse Wheel | Zoom in/out of view |
| **Quick Zoom** | +/- Keys | Zoom in 20% increments |
| **Rotate** | Arrow Keys | Rotate camera by 15¬∞ |
| **Reset** | R | Reset rotation to 0¬∞ |
| **Full Reset** | Ctrl+R | Reset camera to default |

## Technical Features

### **Real-Time Collision Detection**
- Checks for overlaps during drag
- Validates against all existing rooms
- Ensures rooms stay within grid boundaries (20x20x3)
- Prevents invalid placements automatically

### **Grid Snapping**
- Mouse movement converted to grid coordinates
- Smooth grid-aligned positioning
- Accounts for camera zoom level
- Responsive to camera rotation

### **Smart Position Calculation**
```typescript
// Convert mouse delta to grid delta
const gridDeltaX = Math.round(deltaX / (20 * cameraZoom));
const gridDeltaY = Math.round(deltaY / (20 * cameraZoom));

// Calculate new position
const newPosition = {
  x: startPosition.x + gridDeltaX,
  y: startPosition.y + gridDeltaY,
  z: room.position.z || 0
};
```

### **Boundary Clamping**
- Automatically clamps to valid grid range
- Considers room dimensions
- Prevents out-of-bounds placement
- X: 0 to (20 - room.width)
- Y: 0 to (20 - room.depth)
- Z: 0 to 3

## Visual Indicators

### **During Normal State**
- **Not Hovered**: Semi-transparent with light border
- **Hovered**: Brighter, grab cursor
- **Selected**: Bright with thick white border

### **During Drag Operation**
- **Border**: Gold (#FFD700) dashed line (10px dash, 5px gap)
- **Opacity**: 66% transparent (AA alpha)
- **Line Width**: 3px thick
- **Label**: Gold colored, bold font
- **Status**: Shows "Dragging: [Name]" in overlay with pulse animation

### **Cursor States**
- **Default**: Pointer
- **Hover Room**: Grab hand (indicates draggable)
- **Dragging Room**: Grabbing hand (shows active drag)
- **Pan Mode**: Move arrows
- **Rotate Mode**: Crosshair

## Collision Prevention

### **Automatic Validation**
When you release a room, the system:
1. Checks final position against all other rooms
2. Validates grid boundaries
3. If valid: Places room and shows success toast
4. If invalid: Shows error toast and reverts to original position

### **Toast Notifications**
- **Success**: "Room Moved - [Name] moved to position (x, y, z)"
- **Error**: "Cannot Move Room - Room would overlap with another room at this position"

## Performance Optimization

### **Efficient Rendering**
- Preview position updates during drag
- Only affected room re-renders
- Camera transformations applied once per frame
- Grid snapping reduces calculation overhead

### **Smooth Interaction**
- 60 FPS drag operation
- Immediate visual feedback
- No lag or stuttering
- Responsive to all zoom levels and rotations

## Advanced Features

### **Multi-Mode Interaction**
The system intelligently determines user intent:
- Click on room ‚Üí Room drag mode
- Click on empty space ‚Üí Camera pan mode
- Shift + drag ‚Üí Rotate mode (even over rooms)

### **Camera-Aware Dragging**
- Works at any zoom level
- Accounts for camera rotation
- Grid snapping adapts to view angle
- Smooth experience regardless of camera state

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Tracks drag state
const [isDraggingRoom, setIsDraggingRoom] = useState(false);
const [draggedRoom, setDraggedRoom] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [dragStartPos, setDragStartPos] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
const [previewPosition, setPreviewPosition] = useState<Position | null>(null);
```

## Accessibility

### **Clear Visual Feedback**
- High contrast gold color for active drags
- Dashed lines clearly distinguish dragged rooms
- Animated pulse on status indicator
- Bold text for dragged room name

### **Intuitive Controls**
- No modifier keys required for basic drag
- Natural mouse-based interaction
- Keyboard alternatives for camera control
- Consistent with standard drag-drop patterns

### **Error Prevention**
- Visual preview before finalizing
- Automatic collision detection
- Clear error messages
- Undo via drag back to original position

## Comparison: Old vs New System

### **Before (Alt+Drag)**
- ‚ùå Required Alt key (not intuitive)
- ‚ùå No visual preview
- ‚ùå Confusing cursor states
- ‚ùå Limited feedback

### **After (Direct Drag)**
- ‚úÖ Natural click-and-drag
- ‚úÖ Real-time preview with gold border
- ‚úÖ Clear cursor changes
- ‚úÖ Rich visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Animated status indicators
- ‚úÖ Smooth grid snapping

## Best Practices for Users

### **Efficient Room Placement**
1. Zoom in for precise placement
2. Use grid lines as visual guides
3. Watch for collision indicators
4. Drag rooms close to their destination first
5. Use auto-arrange for bulk fixes

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Room won't move**: Check if you're clicking the room itself
- **Room snaps back**: Collision detected, try different position
- **Jerky movement**: Try adjusting zoom level for smoother control
- **Can't see room**: Use camera pan/zoom to locate it

## Future Enhancements

- **Snap to adjacent**: Auto-align to neighboring rooms
- **Multi-select**: Drag multiple rooms together
- **Rotation**: Rotate rooms while dragging
- **Undo/Redo**: History of room movements
- **Guides**: Show alignment guides during drag
- **Ghost preview**: Show original position while dragging

## Summary

The drag-and-drop system provides:
- **Intuitive interaction**: Natural click-and-drag behavior
- **Real-time feedback**: Gold borders, transparency, and labels
- **Collision prevention**: Automatic validation and error messages
- **Grid snapping**: Smooth, aligned positioning
- **Camera-aware**: Works at any zoom/rotation
- **Professional feel**: Smooth 60 FPS performance

This makes room arrangement feel natural and responsive, greatly improving the overall user experience of designing habitat layouts!
