# 🎨 Visual Feedback Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Added comprehensive visual feedback system for when objects are added to rooms in the Habitat Layout Creator game.

---

## ✨ Features Added

### 1. **Toast Notifications**

When an object is successfully added:
- **Success Toast**: Shows object icon, name, and room name
- **Duration**: 3 seconds
- **Example**: "✨ Object added! 🛏️ Sleep Pod added to Sleep Quarters 1"

Error notifications for:
- **No room selected**: Prompts user to select a room first
- **Incompatible object**: Warns when object doesn't fit room type

### 2. **Isometric View Animation**

Objects display with special effects for 2 seconds after being added:

#### Visual Effects:
- **Larger Icon**: 24px vs 18px (33% larger)
- **Golden Glow**: Glowing aura using shadowBlur
- **Sparkle Effects**: 4 golden sparkles around the object
- **Highlight**: Bright white color vs standard semi-transparent

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Golden glow effect
ctx.shadowColor = '#FFD700';
ctx.shadowBlur = 15;

// Sparkles at corners
sparkles = [
  { x: -15, y: -15 }, { x: 15, y: -15 },
  { x: -15, y: 15 }, { x: 15, y: 15 }
];
```

### 3. **Build Panel Enhancements**

#### Room Selection Indicator:
- **Visual Card**: Shows selected room with primary color theme
- **Check Icon**: ✓ to indicate active selection
- **Object Counter**: Badge showing number of objects in room
- **Room Name**: Displays current room being edited

#### Empty State:
- **Icon**: 📦 Large box icon
- **Message**: "Select a room to add objects"
- **Instructions**: "Click on a room in the isometric view"

### 4. **Object Rendering in Isometric View**

Objects are now fully rendered in rooms:
- **Shadow**: Elliptical shadow beneath each object
- **Icon Display**: Emoji icon centered on object position
- **Recent Highlight**: Golden glow and sparkles for newly added
- **Layering**: Objects rendered after walls, before crew
