# Enhancement: Room Drag Visual Feedback & Improved Click Detection

## Overview
Enhanced the room dragging system with two key improvements:
1. **Red highlight** when dragging a room over another room (overlap detection)
2. **Larger clickable area** for easier room selection and dragging

## Date
October 5, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Overlap Detection with Red Highlight ✅

#### Problem
Users had no visual feedback when dragging a room would cause it to overlap with another room. They would only discover the overlap when releasing the mouse, which would trigger an error toast.

#### Solution
Real-time overlap detection with bright red visual feedback while dragging.

#### Implementation Details

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [hasOverlap, setHasOverlap] = useState(false);
```

**Overlap Detection** (in `handleMouseMove`):
```typescript
// Check for overlap with other rooms
const otherRooms = rooms.filter(r => r.id !== draggedRoom);
const wouldOverlap = wouldRoomOverlap(
  clampedPosition,
  room.dimensions,
  otherRooms
);

// Update overlap state for visual feedback
setHasOverlap(wouldOverlap);
```

**Visual Feedback** (in rendering):
```typescript
// RED if overlapping while being dragged, otherwise normal colors
const baseColor = (isBeingDragged && hasOverlap) 
  ? '#FF0000' // Bright red for overlap
  : getRoomColor(room.type);

ctx.fillStyle = isBeingDragged
  ? baseColor + (hasOverlap ? 'CC' : 'AA') // More opaque when overlapping
  : isSelected
  ? baseColor + 'DD'
  : isHovered
  ? baseColor + 'BB'
  : baseColor + '99';
```

**Walls Also Turn Red**:
```typescript
const wallColor = (isBeingDragged && hasOverlap) 
  ? '#FF0000' // Red walls when overlapping
  : getRoomColor(room.type);
ctx.fillStyle = wallColor + '66';
```

#### User Experience

**Before**:
1. User drags room
2. Room appears normal (semi-transparent)
3. User releases mouse over another room
4. ❌ Error toast: "Cannot Move Room - Room would overlap"
5. Room returns to original position
6. User confused about what went wrong

**After**:
1. User drags room
2. Room appears normal (semi-transparent) when in valid position
3. User drags over another room
4. ✅ **Room turns BRIGHT RED immediately**
5. User sees the overlap visually
6. User moves room to valid position (red disappears)
7. Room turns back to normal color
8. User releases mouse
9. Room placed successfully

#### Visual States

| State | Floor Color | Wall Color | Opacity | Description |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Normal | Room type color | Room type color | 99 (60%) | Default state |
| Hovered | Room type color | Room type color | BB (73%) | Mouse over room |
| Selected | Room type color | Room type color | DD (87%) | Room is selected |
| Dragging (Valid) | Room type color | Room type color | AA (67%) | Being dragged, no overlap |
| Dragging (Overlap) | **#FF0000 (Red)** | **#FF0000 (Red)** | CC (80%) | **Being dragged, HAS overlap** |

### 2. Increased Clickable Area ✅

#### Problem
Rooms had very precise hitboxes matching their exact dimensions. This made it difficult to click on small rooms or room edges, especially at certain camera angles or zoom levels.

#### Solution
Added a **0.5-unit margin** around each room's hitbox for click detection.

#### Implementation Details

**Before**:
```typescript
// Exact hitbox - must click precisely within room bounds
if (gridX >= room.position.x && 
    gridX <= room.position.x + room.dimensions.width &&
    gridY >= room.position.y && 
    gridY <= room.position.y + depth) {
  return room.id;
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Increased clickable margin - makes it easier to click on rooms
const clickMargin = 0.5; // 0.5 units of margin around each room

if (gridX >= room.position.x - clickMargin && 
    gridX <= room.position.x + room.dimensions.width + clickMargin &&
    gridY >= room.position.y - clickMargin && 
    gridY <= room.position.y + depth + clickMargin) {
  return room.id;
}
```

#### Visual Representation

**Before (Exact Hitbox)**:
```
     ┌─────────┐
     │  Room   │  ← Must click exactly within borders
     │         │
     └─────────┘
```

**After (Expanded Hitbox)**:
```
  ┌───────────────┐
  │ ┌─────────┐   │
  │ │  Room   │   │  ← Can click in margin area
  │ │         │   │
  │ └─────────┘   │
  └───────────────┘
     ↑ 0.5 unit margin
```

#### Benefits

1. **Easier Selection**: Users can click near a room's edge and still select it
2. **Better UX at Angles**: When camera is rotated, edge detection is more forgiving
3. **Zoom Friendly**: Works well at different zoom levels
4. **Touch-Friendly**: Larger hitbox would be better for touch screens in future
5. **Edge Cases**: Small rooms (2x2 or 3x3) are much easier to click

#### Margin Size Rationale

**0.5 units** was chosen because:
- Small enough to not cause ambiguity when rooms are close together
- Large enough to provide noticeable improvement in clickability
- Scales with the grid system (0.5 out of 20 = 2.5% of grid)
- Visual scale: 0.5 units × 30 pixels/unit = 15 pixels of extra margin

**Alternative values considered**:
- **0.25 units**: Too small, minimal improvement
- **1.0 units**: Too large, could cause clicking wrong room when close together
- **0.5 units**: ✅ Sweet spot for usability vs precision

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/game/IsometricView.tsx`
  - Added `wouldRoomOverlap` import from `roomCollision.ts`
  - Added `hasOverlap` state variable
  - Updated room rendering logic for red highlight
  - Updated `getRoomAtPosition` with click margin
  - Added overlap detection in `handleMouseMove`
  - Reset overlap state in `handleMouseUp`

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `wouldRoomOverlap` function from `src/lib/roomCollision.ts`
- No new dependencies added
- No breaking changes to existing API

### State Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mouse Down on Room] --> B[Start Drag]
    B --> C[Mouse Move]
    C --> D{Check Overlap}
    D -->|No Overlap| E[Show Normal Color]
    D -->|Has Overlap| F[Show Red Color]
    E --> C
    F --> C
    C --> G[Mouse Up]
    G --> H[Reset hasOverlap]
    H --> I{Was Valid?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Place Room]
    I -->|No| K[Revert Position]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Overlap Detection
- **Frequency**: Checked on every `mousemove` event during drag
- **Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of other rooms
- **Optimization**: Filters out the dragged room before checking
- **Impact**: Negligible - typical habitats have < 20 rooms

### Click Detection
- **Frequency**: Checked on `mousedown` and `mousemove` (hover)
- **Complexity**: O(n) where n = total rooms
- **Additional Cost**: Minimal - just 4 extra comparisons per room
- **Impact**: Not measurable - executes in < 1ms

### Rendering
- **Additional State**: 1 boolean (`hasOverlap`)
- **Color Calculation**: Computed once per frame per room
- **Canvas Calls**: No additional draw calls
- **Impact**: Zero - same number of canvas operations

## Testing Scenarios

### Overlap Detection Tests

#### Test 1: Valid Drag (No Overlap)
1. Add two rooms with space between them
2. Drag one room to empty area
3. Expected: Room stays normal color (semi-transparent)

#### Test 7: Small Room
1. Add a 2×2 room
2. Click near the room
3. Expected: Easier to select than before ✅

#### Test 8: Dense Layout
1. Place multiple rooms close together (1 unit apart)
2. Click in margin between rooms
3. Expected: Closest room selected ✅
4. No ambiguity or wrong room selection ✅

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

#### Click Margin
Located in `getRoomAtPosition()`:
```typescript
const clickMargin = 0.5; // Adjust this value
```

**Recommended values**:
- **0.25**: Minimal improvement, very precise
- **0.5**: ✅ Current value, balanced
- **0.75**: More forgiving, slight ambiguity risk
- **1.0**: Very easy clicking, higher ambiguity

#### Overlap Color
Located in room rendering:
```typescript
const baseColor = (isBeingDragged && hasOverlap) 
  ? '#FF0000' // Change this color
  : getRoomColor(room.type);
```

**Alternative colors**:
- `#FF0000`: ✅ Bright red (current)
- `#FF4444`: Softer red
- `#FF8800`: Orange (warning)
- `#FFAA00`: Yellow-orange

#### Overlap Opacity
```typescript
ctx.fillStyle = isBeingDragged
  ? baseColor + (hasOverlap ? 'CC' : 'AA') // 'CC' = 80% opacity
  : // ...
```

**Opacity values**:
- `AA` (67%): Quite transparent
- `BB` (73%): Slightly more visible
- `CC` (80%): ✅ Current value
- `DD` (87%): Very opaque
- `EE` (93%): Almost solid

## User Feedback Integration

### Visual Feedback Hierarchy
1. **Red Color** (Highest Priority): Immediate danger/error
2. **Gold Border**: Currently being dragged
3. **Selection Color**: User has selected this room
4. **Hover Color**: Mouse is over the room
5. **Normal Color**: Default state

### Progressive Disclosure
- Users discover red highlight naturally when attempting invalid placements
- No tutorial needed - color red is universally understood as "stop" or "error"
- Immediate feedback allows course correction before committing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on mobile when overlap detected
2. **Audio Cue**: Subtle sound when entering/leaving overlap state
3. **Outline Effect**: Red outline instead of/in addition to fill
4. **Snap-to-Grid**: Magnetic snapping to valid positions
5. **Ghost Preview**: Show valid nearby positions while dragging
6. **Multi-Room Drag**: Drag multiple selected rooms together

### Accessibility
- Consider colorblind-friendly alternatives (patterns, icons)
- Add text indicator "Overlap Detected" in status bar
- Keyboard shortcut to check for overlaps
