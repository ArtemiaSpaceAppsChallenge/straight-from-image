# Room Drag Enhancements - Quick Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Red Highlight on Overlap ‚úÖ
When dragging a room, it now **turns bright red** if it would overlap with another room.

**Visual Feedback**:
- üü¢ **Normal Color**: Room can be placed here (valid position)
- üî¥ **RED Color**: Room overlaps with another (invalid position)

**Benefits**:
- Users see overlap **immediately** during drag
- No need to wait for error message after releasing
- Clear visual warning prevents mistakes

### 2. Bigger Click Area ‚úÖ
Rooms are now **easier to click** with an invisible 0.5-unit margin around them.

**What Changed**:
- Before: Had to click exactly on the room
- After: Can click near the room's edge and still select it

**Benefits**:
- Easier to select small rooms
- Better at different camera angles
- More forgiving click detection

## How to Test

### Test Overlap Detection
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/play
2. Add two rooms
3. Drag one room toward the other
4. **Watch it turn RED** when it overlaps ‚úÖ
5. Move away from overlap
6. Room turns back to normal color ‚úÖ

### Test Bigger Click Area
1. Add a room
2. Click near the edge of the room (not directly on it)
3. Room should still be selected ‚úÖ
4. Small rooms are much easier to click now ‚úÖ

## Visual States

| Situation | Color | What It Means |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Dragging (valid position) | Normal room color | ‚úÖ OK to place here |
| Dragging (overlapping) | **BRIGHT RED** | ‚ùå Cannot place here |
| Normal | Room type color | Not being moved |
| Selected | Room type color (brighter) | Currently selected |
| Hovered | Room type color (medium) | Mouse over room |

## Technical Details

**File Modified**: `src/components/game/IsometricView.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
1. Added `hasOverlap` state to track overlaps
2. Check for overlap on every mouse move during drag
3. Render room in red (#FF0000) when overlapping
4. Increased click margin from 0 to 0.5 units

**Performance**: Zero impact - runs smoothly

## Quick Config

### Change Click Margin
```typescript
// In getRoomAtPosition()
const clickMargin = 0.5; // Default: 0.5, Range: 0.25-1.0
```

### Change Overlap Color
```typescript
// In room rendering
const baseColor = (isBeingDragged && hasOverlap) 
  ? '#FF0000' // Change to '#FF8800' for orange, etc.
  : getRoomColor(room.type);
```

## Status
‚úÖ **WORKING** - Both features are live!

- Red highlight: Active during all room drags
- Bigger click area: Active for all room selection
